                                          <h3>Jannatul Ferdous meaning</h3>
                                          <p>The literal meaning of Jannah is garden, and Firdaus is paradise. But to take it further, in Islam, we
                                          believe there are many different layers of Heaven. Jannatul Firdaus would be the highest level of heaven, it is where you would find Prophet Muhammad (saws). Other Common Spellings (transliteration): jannah al firdous.</p>
